<h1>Whales</h1>
<p>
Wikipedia tells us this about <strong>whales:</strong>
<p/>
  <p>
    <blockquote>
    Whale is the common name for various marine mammals of the order Cetacean. The
    term whale sometimes refers to all cetaceans, but more often it includes dolphins
    and porpoises, which belong to the suborder Odonteci(toothed whales). This suborder
    includes the sperm whale, killer whale, pilot whale, and beluga whale. The other
    cetacean suborder, Mysticeti(baleen whales), comprises filter feeders who eat
    small organisms caught by straining seawater through a comblike structure found
    in the mouth called baleen. This suborder includes the blue whale, the humpback
    whale, the bowhead whale and the minke whale. All cetaceans have forelimbs
    modified as fins, aq tail with horizontal flukes, and openings(blowholes) on top
    of the head.

<p>
But I like whales because they are:
  <ul>
    <li>Huge!</li>
    <li>Friendly</li>
    <li>Can hold their breathe for a long time</li>
</ul>

Whale Anatomy
</h2>

<p>
There are some key parts to a whale's anatomy that I think are interesting.
</p>

<p>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>
      <strong>Blowhole:</strong> Whales breathe via blowholes; baleen whales have two and toothed
      whales have one. These are located on top of the head, allowing the animal to
      remain almost completely submerged while breathing. Breathing involves expelling
      stale air(which is warm and moist), as well as some mucus and excess water from
      the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy, spout, followed by inhaling fresh air
      into the lungs. Spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification.
      </li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>
      <strong>Ears:</strong> The whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In
      humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside
      air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In aquatic mammals,
      such as whales, however, there is no great difference between the outer and
      inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle
      ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low
      -impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically
      isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater
      directional hearing underwater.
    </li>
  </ol>
